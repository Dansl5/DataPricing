Question2a
\begin{align*}
Q=4-(1/3)\\
(1/3)P=4-Q\\
P=12-3Q 
\end{align*}

Question2b

```{r}
# Define the function
f <- function(x) {
  return(12 - 3*x)
}

# Create a sequence of x values
x <- seq(0, 4, by = 1)

# Calculate the corresponding y values using the function
y <- f(x)

# Create the plot
plot(x, y, type = "l", col = "blue", xlab = "Quantity", ylab = "Price", main = "Graph of the inverse demand curve")
```
